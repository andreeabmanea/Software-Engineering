In D1 we have the xmi diagram, the java files which contains the classes generated by ArgoUML. Then we will compile them and we'll get compiled classes.
In D2 we have the java decompiler, compiled classes, and decompiled classes which are of type jad. We will change them to type java so we can get them to ArgoUML.
